# Word_Graph

This project was created as the Final Project for Georgetown University's Literature and Technology Summer 2016 class. 
Opening the "main-app.html" file in a browser allows users to enter a text file and enter words from the text they'd like to graph. 
The idea is to allow users to gain a better understanding of when words are used throughout the novel and provide a starting point for a deeper analysis of the text.<br><br>
